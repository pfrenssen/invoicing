Feature: Create client
  In order to manage my clients
  As a business owner
  I need to be able to add a new client to the database

Scenario Outline: Website field validation for correct entries
  Given a client with website "<website>"
  Then the client website should be valid

  Examples:
  | website                                                   |
  | http://localhost                                          |
  | http://localhost/                                         |
  | http://127.0.0.1/                                         |
  | https://twitter.com                                       |
  | https://twitter.com/                                      |
