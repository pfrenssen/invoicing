Scenario Outline: Check labels for inline entities
  Given I am logged in as a user with the "business owner" role
  When I go to the add invoice form
  Then I should see the fieldset with the legend "<legend>"
  When I press the "<add new>" button
  Then I should see the fieldset with the legend "<add new>"
  And I should see the button "<create>"
